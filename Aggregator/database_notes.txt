3. Done, now enter any postgres commands you'd like

To create a new database:
CREATE DATABASE dbname;

List all databases:
\l

List tables:
\d

List table columns:
\d table_name

List all database sequences:
\ds

Connect to database:
\c db_name

Exit database:
\q

Delete database (DANGEROUS!!):
DROP DATABASE db_name;

Create table inside database:
1. Connect to database
CREATE TABLE recipe(
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    website TEXT NOT NULL,
    authors TEXT[],
    authors_urls TEXT[],
    difficulty TEXT,
    yield TEXT,
    time TEXT[],
    ingredients TEXT[],
    directions TEXT[]
);

Insert row into table:
INSERT INTO recipe (name,url,website) values ('foo','bar','fum');

Remove row from table:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE (condition);
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = 32;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE name = 'bob';

Remove all rows from table:
DELETE FROM table_name;

Select all rows from table:
SELECT * FROM table_name

Select specific row from table:
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'Sarah';
SELECT * FROM recipe WHERE url = 'bla';

Alter existing sequences:
ALTER SEQUENCE product_id_seq RESTART WITH number

Reset auto increment counter:
TRUNCATE TABLE recipe RESTART IDENTITY; (DANGEROUS!!! DELETES TABLE)

How to re-order id sequence in table from 1-1000. Instead of it being 232-1232.

Get size of table:
SELECT pg_size_pretty( pg_total_relation_size('table_name'));

Database Structure:

Problem: I don't want recipes w/ "Black Olives" to pop-up if the user types "Olives Black"
Solution: We add ingredients in order into the join table. "Olives" will show up before "Black". So when reference join talbe, we check the join tables ID to get the order added.


CREATE TABLE join_table(
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    recipe_id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL,
    ingredient_id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE ingredient(
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

Delete duplicate entries:
DELETE FROM recipe a USING (
      SELECT MIN(ctid) as ctid, image_url
        FROM recipe 
        GROUP BY image_url HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
      ) b
      WHERE a.image_url = b.image_url 
      AND a.ctid <> b.ctid;


Count rows in table:


Delete duplicate recipes:
DELETE FROM join_table
WHERE recipe_id IN (
  SELECT a.id
  FROM recipe a
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT MIN(ctid) as ctid, ingredients
    FROM recipe 
    GROUP BY ingredients HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  ) b
  ON a.ingredients = b.ingredients 
  AND a.ctid <> b.ctid
);


DELETE FROM recipe
USING (
  SELECT MIN(ctid) as ctid, ingredients
  FROM recipe 
  GROUP BY ingredients HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) b
WHERE recipe.ingredients = b.ingredients 
AND recipe.ctid <> b.ctid;


Create table from another table (no data, just the command to create a new version of itself):
sudo su - postgres
pg_dump --schema-only --table=recipe recipes > recipe.sql

Restart postgres service:
sudo service postgresql restart

Change postgres password:
\password
